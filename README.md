# autobound
Repository for GSoC 2019 [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5892666334642176).<br>

Currently Implemented Features:
* `Collect Data - AutoBound` - This can be found under the Tools Menu. This is used to download and save data to train the AutoBound's Image Segmentation Model.
* `AutoBound` MapMode - The plugin side of the tool is almost completed but the server side is still under development.

The above functionalities require the [AutoBound Server](https://github.com/BBloggsbott/autoboundserver/) to be running.
